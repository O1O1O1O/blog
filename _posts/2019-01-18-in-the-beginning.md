This is the first post of my new [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered blog. Thanks to Barry Clark's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo for making it easy and not requiring any commandline tools, I can add and edit posts online with [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or since it using [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format for posts I can use the excellent [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) to edit pages and push to GitHub. Once I've finished messing with DNS this will also be registered with [Basic Attention Token](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) as a channel for publisher rewards when anyone using the new [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) visits.  Eventually Brave will show ads for those that don't want to contribute, and ad-free pages for those that do.  In the mean time enjoy an ad-free experience.  You're welcome...

Stay tuned for future posts.
